- 👋 Hi, I’m @rirehkemper
- 👀 I’m interested in Aviation, matial arts, and of course programming. I was an airline pilot for a bit, but want to change to a more creative and less volatile field, hence here I am.
At some point, I am working on my Masters in Software Engineering and pursuing courses in AI and robotics.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Several software languages. Python, Java, Javascript, and C++ are all languages I've worked with; Java being my strongest so far. I'm close to finishing my Bachelors
in Computer Science from SNHU, and I can't wait to hone my skills in a professional environment!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on games, mostly. I have so many game ideas!  I'm learning the intricacies of programming games as well, I just have a hunch that there are better ways to make a game
than programming from scratch in Java; however I love the idea of fully customizing every aspect of a game. 
- 📫 Reach me at anytime through my email rirehkemper@gmail.com.  I'm open to ideas, suggestions, and fellow programmers opinions and collaborations!
